# NodeLocalStorage
Node-localstorage is a module or package in Node.js 
Node-localstorage is a module or package in Node.js that provides a simple API for using a localStorage-like storage mechanism in a Node.js environment. It allows you to store key-value pairs in the local storage, similar to how you would do in a web browser.

The node-localstorage module is particularly useful when you need to persist data across multiple sessions or instances of your Node.js application. It emulates the localStorage API available in web browsers but works within the Node.js runtime environment.
Here's a basic example of how you can use node-localstorage:

Install the module:
npm install node-localstorage
Require the module in your Node.js application:
const { LocalStorage } = require('node-localstorage');
Create a new instance of LocalStorage and specify the storage directory:
const localStorage = new LocalStorage('./storage');
In this example, the './storage' directory is where the data will be stored. You can choose any directory on your system.

Use the localStorage instance to set and get values:
localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
console.log(localStorage.getItem('key')); // Output: 'value'

The node-localstorage module provides various methods similar to the localStorage API, such as setItem, getItem, removeItem, clear, and key. These methods allow you to store, retrieve, remove, clear, and access keys within the local storage.
